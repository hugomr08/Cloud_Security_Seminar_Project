Created by Hugo Munoz and Shakoor Mahmood

1. Cloud Platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

2. Virtual Machines or Instances Set up virtual machines or instances on your chosen cloud platform(s) to act as targets for penetration testing. These instances should be intentionally vulnerable to simulate real-world scenarios.

3. Penetration Testing Tools**:
   - *Scanners*: Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nmap for vulnerability scanning.
   - *Exploitation Frameworks*: Metasploit or ExploitDB can help in exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - *Enumeration Tools*: Tools like CloudMapper or CloudEnum can assist in discovering cloud resources and configurations.
   - *Security Monitoring*: Consider using tools like Security Monkey or AWS Config for continuous monitoring of security configurations.

4. Programming Languages**:
   - Python: Often used for scripting and automation tasks. Libraries like Boto3 can interact with cloud APIs.
   - Bash Scripting: Useful for creating custom scripts to automate tasks or exploit vulnerabilities.
   - Powershell: If targeting Azure, Powershell scripting can be handy for automation and interacting with Azure resources.

5. Source Code Repository: Set up a repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab to store your project's source code. Make sure to include scripts, configurations, and any custom tools developed for the project.

6. Video Recording: Record demonstrations of your penetration testing process, including setup, execution, and results. Ensure that the video clearly shows each step and any tools being used.

7. Documentation: Prepare documentation detailing the steps taken during the penetration testing, including findings, vulnerabilities discovered, and recommendations for remediation.

8. Presentation Materials: Prepare slides or other presentation materials to accompany your project demonstration. These should highlight key findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the project.
